search(arr, checkFunction, transformFunc):
    args:
        arr -> is an array.
        transformFunc -> receives a value and transform it using a complex function. this function is optional. Returns a transformed value.
        checkFunction -> is the function to check if a value is the correct one, returns boolean.
    Returns a tuple with:
        -flag found
        -the global index where it was found
        -the value that it was after the transformation

stencil2D(data,radius,filterFunction):
    args:
        data -> is an array of 2 dimensions.
        radius -> is the size of the radius of the filter (filter has always the same size in rows and in collumns).
        filterFunction -> is a function that receives a sub_array with the same shape as the filter. It uses the filter on that subArray and returns a single processed value.
    Returns the modified array

stencil1D is similar to stencil2D.
